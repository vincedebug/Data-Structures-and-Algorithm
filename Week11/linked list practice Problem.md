**Basic Linked List Problems**

These problems will help you understand fundamental linked list operations and manipulations:

1. **Traversal and Printing:**
   - [x] Write a function to print the data of all nodes in a linked list. (We already covered this one!)
   - [x] Write a function to print the data of every other node in a linked list.
   - [x] Write a function to print the data of a linked list in reverse order (without actually reversing the list itself).

2. **Node Insertion:**
   - [x] Write a function to insert a new node at the beginning of a linked list.
   - [ ] Write a function to insert a new node at the end of a linked list.
   - [ ] Write a function to insert a new node at a specific position (e.g., after the 3rd node) in a linked list.

3. **Node Deletion:**
   - Write a function to delete the first node of a linked list.
   - Write a function to delete the last node of a linked list.
   - Write a function to delete a node with a specific value from a linked list.

4. **List Manipulation:**
   - Write a function to count the number of nodes in a linked list.
   - Write a function to find the middle node of a linked list.
   - Write a function to reverse a linked list.

**Slightly More Challenging Problems:**

5. **Searching:**
   - Write a function to search for a node with a specific value in a linked list and return its position.
   - Write a function to determine if a linked list contains a cycle (i.e., a loop).

6. **List Comparison:**
   - Write a function to compare two linked lists to see if they are identical.

**Tips for Solving Linked List Problems:**

* **Visualize:** Draw diagrams of the linked list to understand how the pointers are changing during operations.
* **Edge Cases:** Consider edge cases like empty lists, single-node lists, and operations on the first or last node.
* **Pointers:** Be mindful of how you're manipulating pointers. Incorrect pointer operations can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
* **Test Thoroughly:** Test your code with various inputs and edge cases to ensure it works correctly.

Remember, practice is key to mastering linked lists. Start with the basic problems and gradually move on to more complex ones. If you get stuck, don't hesitate to ask for help or look for solutions online, but try to understand the logic behind them.
